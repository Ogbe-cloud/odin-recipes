		 <li>2 ¼ pounds chicken wings, split and tips discarded</li>
		 <li>1 tablespoon fish sauce (Optional)</li>
		 <li>5 ¼ cups chicken broth</li>
		 <li>1 cup glutinous sweet rice</li>

	 <h4>step 1</h4>
	 <p>
		Heat oil in a large pot over
		 medium heat. Cook and stir onion,
		  garlic, and ginger in hot oil until 
		  fragrant, about 5 minutes.
		   Add chicken wings; cook and stir 
		   for 1 minute. Stir in fish sauce,
		    cover, and cook another 2 minutes.
	 </p>
	 <h4>step 2</h4>
	 <p>
		Pour chicken broth into the pot.
		 Stir in sweet rice and bring mixture to a boil. 
		 Cover and cook for 10 minutes, stirring 
		 occasionally to prevent rice from sticking
		  to the bottom of the pot. Season with salt 
		  and pepper.
	 </p>
	 <h4>step 3</h4>
	 <p>
		Portion soup into bowls and 
		garnish with green onion. 
		Serve with lemon slices and additional fish sauce,
		 if desired.
